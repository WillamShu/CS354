Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

-----------------------------------------
./intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:20 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:23 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:26 2016
^C
----------------------------------------

Q: How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statement?
1. In intdate.c, we set a 3 seconds alarm.
2. Then, we create our own handler SIGALRM.
3. After 3 seconds, SIGALRM will be called and sent to the program by the system.
4. In SIGALRM, we print the time first, then reset the alarm to go off for 3 seconds.
5. The handler returns, and keep executing the main program in the infinite loop.
6. After 3 seconds, call another SIGALRM and continues...
