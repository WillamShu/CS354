For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes, and set associativity of 1, for both
the I-cache and the D-cache.

Sample command line:
/p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/pin -injection child -t /p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db <block-size> -- yourexe

Replace "yourexe" with the name of your executable.

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
Instruction cache misses:   720
Instruction cache references:   151863
Data cache misses:    18660
Data cache references:    103140


1.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

Data cache hit ratio = 0.981966

2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
Instruction cache misses:   705
Instruction cache references:   151863
Data cache misses:    3590
Data cache references:    103111

2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

Data cache hit ratio = 0.965183

3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)

Instruction cache misses:   724
Instruction cache references:   16595381
Data cache misses:    1507450
Data cache references:    12045651

3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

Data cache hit ratio = 0.874855

4. (to be answered without running pin)
For this question, assume that the 100,000 elements long integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory,
the size of an integer is 4 bytes  and the D-cache is initially empty.
As you READ the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0,
how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is:

a) 4 bytes: 39.2786

b) 32 bytes: 38.60732

c) 64 bytes: 34.9942

5. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the D-cache?
Why? In what way does the block size affect the hit ratio for this program?

4 bytes is the best. Since it has the highest hit ratio.

Instruction cache references:   16595381
Data cache misses:    1507450
Data cache references:    12045651

7.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

Data cache hit ratio = 0.874855

8. (to be answered without running pin)
For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory,
the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty.
As you READ the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0],
how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of:

a) cache2Drows: 9.11

b) cache2Dcols: 8.74

9. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 6 and 7.
Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".
